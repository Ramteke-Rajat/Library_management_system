![Library_project](https://github.com/Ramteke-Rajat/Library_management_system/blob/main/Library%20image.jpg?raw=true)

## Objectives

1. **Set up the Library Management System Database**: Create and populate the database with tables for branches, employees, members, books, issued status, and return status.
2. **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the data.
3. **CTAS (Create Table As Select)**: Utilize CTAS to create new tables based on query results.
4. **Advanced SQL Queries**: Develop complex queries to analyze and retrieve specific data.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup
![ERD](https://github.com/Ramteke-Rajat/Library_management_system/blob/main/ERD.pgerd.png?raw=true)

- **Database Creation**: Created a database named `library_project_2`.
- **Table Creation**: Created tables for branches, employees, members, books, issued status, and return status. Each table includes relevant columns and relationships.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE library_project_2;

-- creating branch table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS branch;
CREATE TABLE branch
	(
            branch_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
            manager_id VARCHAR(10),
            branch_address VARCHAR(50),
            contact_no VARCHAR(10)
	);

-- creating employees table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employees;
CREATE TABLE employees
	(
            emp_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
	emp_name VARCHAR(25),
	position VARCHAR(15),
	salary INT,
	branch_id VARCHAR(10)  --FK
	);

-- creating books table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS books;
CREATE TABLE books
	(
            isbn VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
	book_title VARCHAR(60),
	category VARCHAR(20),
	rental_price FLOAT,
	status VARCHAR(10),
	author VARCHAR(30),
	publisher VARCHAR(30)
	);

-- creating members table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS members;
CREATE TABLE members
	(
	member_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
	member_name VARCHAR(30),
	member_address VARCHAR(30),
	reg_date DATE
	);

-- creating issued_status table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS issued_status;
CREATE TABLE issued_status
	(
	issued_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
	issued_member_id VARCHAR(10),  --FK
	issued_book_name VARCHAR(75),
	issued_date DATE,
	issued_book_isbn VARCHAR(20),  --FK
	issued_emp_id VARCHAR(10)  --FK
	);

-- creating return_status table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS return_status;
CREATE TABLE return_status
	(
	return_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
	issued_id VARCHAR(10),  --FK
	return_book_name VARCHAR(75),
	return_date DATE,
	return_book_isbn VARCHAR(20)  
	);
```

### 2. CRUD Operations

- **Create**: Inserted sample records into the `books` table.
- **Read**: Retrieved and displayed data from various tables.
- **Update**: Updated records in the `employees` table.
- **Delete**: Removed records from the `members` table as needed.

### 3. Created relationships between table using foreign keys

```sql
ALTER TABLE issued_status
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_members
FOREIGN KEY (issued_member_id)
REFERENCES members(member_id);


ALTER TABLE issued_status
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_books
FOREIGN KEY (issued_book_isbn)
REFERENCES books(isbn);


ALTER TABLE issued_status
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_employees
FOREIGN KEY (issued_emp_id)
REFERENCES employees(emp_id);


ALTER TABLE employees
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_branch
FOREIGN KEY (branch_id)
REFERENCES branch(branch_id);

ALTER TABLE return_status
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_issued_status
FOREIGN KEY (issued_id)
REFERENCES issued_status(issued_id);
```

### 4. Porject Tasks

**Task 1. Create a New Book Record**
-- "978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.')"

```sql
INSERT INTO books(isbn, book_title, category, rental_price, status, author, publisher)
VALUES('978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.');
SELECT * FROM books;
```
**Task 2: Update an Existing Member's Address**

```sql
UPDATE members
SET member_name = 'Rajat Ramteke'
WHERE member_id = 'C102'
SELECT * FROM members
```

**Task 3: Delete a Record from the Issued Status Table**
-- Objective: Delete the record with issued_id = 'IS121' from the issued_status table.

```sql
DELETE FROM issued_status
WHERE   issued_id =   'IS121';
```

**Task 4: Retrieve All Books Issued by a Specific Employee**

FROM issued_status
GROUP BY issued_emp_id
HAVING COUNT(issued_id) > 1
```

### 5. CTAS (Create Table As Select)

**Task 6: Create Summary Tables**: Used CTAS to generate new tables based on query results - each book and total book_issued_cnt**

```sql
CREATE TABLE book_count
AS
SELECT 
	b.isbn,
	b.book_title,
	COUNT(ist.issued_id) as no_issued

```

Task 14: **Update Book Status on Return**  
Write a query to update the status of books in the books table to "Yes" when they are returned (based on entries in the return_status table).

```sql

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE add_return_record(p_return_id VARCHAR(10), p_issued_id VARCHAR(10), p_book_quality VARCHAR(15))
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS 
$$

DECLARE
	v_isbn VARCHAR(50);
	v_book_title VARCHAR(75);

BEGIN
	-- logic and code
	-- Insert into return_status based on users input
	INSERT INTO return_status(return_id, issued_id, return_date, book_quality)
	VALUES(p_return_id, p_issued_id, CURRENT_DATE, p_book_quality);

	SELECT
		issued_book_isbn,
		issued_book_name
		INTO
		v_isbn,
		v_book_title
	FROM
		issued_status
	WHERE
		issued_id = p_issued_id;
	UPDATE books
	SET status = 'Yes'
	WHERE isbn = v_isbn;

	RAISE NOTICE 'Thank you for returning the book: %', v_book_title;
END;
$$

-- calling fucntions
CALL add_return_record('RS135', 'IS135', 'Good');

CALL add_return_record('RS138', 'IS140', 'Damaged');

```

Task 15: **Branch Performance Report**  
Create a query that generates a performance report for each branch, showing the number of books issued, the number of books returned, and the total revenue generated from book rentals.

```sql
CREATE TABLE branch_report
AS
SELECT 
	b.branch_id,
	COUNT(ist.issued_id) as num_books_issued,
	COUNT(rs.return_id) as num_books_returned,
	SUM(bk.rental_price) as total_revenue
FROM
	issued_status as ist
JOIN
	employees as e
ON e.emp_id = ist.issued_emp_id
JOIN
	branch as b
ON b.branch_id = e.branch_id
JOIN
	books as bk
ON bk.isbn = ist.issued_book_isbn
LEFT JOIN
	return_status as rs
ON rs.issued_id = ist.issued_id

GROUP BY b.branch_id
ORDER BY SUM(bk.rental_price) DESC;

SELECT * FROM branch_report;
```

Task 16: **CTAS: Create a Table of Active Members**  
Use the CREATE TABLE AS (CTAS) statement to create a new table active_members containing members who have issued at least one book in the last 2 months.

```sql
CREATE TABLE avtive_members
AS
SELECT
	ist.issued_member_id as member_id,
	m.member_name,
	ist.issued_date
FROM
	issued_status as ist
JOIN
	members as m
ON m.member_id = ist.issued_member_id
WHERE
	issued_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '6 month';

SELECT * FROM avtive_members
```

Task 17: **Find Employees with the Most Book Issues Processed**  
Write a query to find the top 3 employees who have processed the most book issues. Display the employee name, number of books processed, and their branch.

```sql
SELECT
	emp.emp_id,
	emp.emp_name,
	COUNT(ist.issued_id) as number_of_books_processed,
	emp.branch_id
FROM
	issued_status as ist
JOIN
	employees as emp
ON emp.emp_id = ist.issued_emp_id
GROUP BY emp.emp_id
ORDER BY COUNT(ist.issued_id) DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

Task 18: **Stored Procedure**
Objective:
Create a stored procedure to manage the status of books in a library system.
Description:
Write a stored procedure that updates the status of a book in the library based on its issuance. The procedure should function as follows:
The stored procedure should take the book_id as an input parameter.
The procedure should first check if the book is available (status = 'yes').
If the book is available, it should be issued, and the status in the books table should be updated to 'no'.
If the book is not available (status = 'no'), the procedure should return an error message indicating that the book is currently not available.

```sql

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE issued_book(p_issued_id VARCHAR(10), p_issued_member_id VARCHAR(10), p_issued_book_isbn VARCHAR(20), p_issued_emp_id VARCHAR(10))
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS
$$

DECLARE
-- all the variables
	v_status VARCHAR(10);

BEGIN
-- all code and logic
	-- checking if the book is available
	
	SELECT status
		INTO
		v_status	
	FROM
		books
	WHERE
		isbn = p_issued_book_isbn;
	IF
		v_status = 'yes'
	THEN
		INSERT INTO issued_status(issued_id, issued_member_id, issued_date, issued_book_isbn, issued_emp_id)
		VALUES(p_issued_id, p_issued_member_id, CURRENT_DATE, p_issued_book_isbn, p_issued_emp_id);

		UPDATE books
		SET status = 'no'
		WHERE isbn = p_issued_book_isbn;

		RAISE NOTICE 'Book record added successfully for book ISBN: %', p_issued_book_isbn;

	ELSE
		RAISE NOTICE 'The book is currently not available.';

	END IF;
END;
$$

-- testing
-- "978-0-7432-7357-1" -- no

CALL issued_book('IS156', 'C110', '978-0-7434-7679-3', 'E105');

SELECT * FROM books
WHERE isbn = '978-0-7434-7679-3';
```
